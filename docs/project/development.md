# Development

Use this page for local setup, focused checks, and the test layout. For the full
automation map, see [Configuration and automation](../reference/configuration.md).

## Setup

```bash
make ready
make hooks-install
```

Use uv for Python dependency management. Outside the devcontainer, install
Node.js and npm so Markdown, spelling, and Dockerfile checks can run.

## Daily loop

```bash
make format
make check
```

Use focused commands while iterating:

```bash
make test
make lint
make typecheck
make docs
make markdownlint
make spellcheck
make workflow-lint
make workflow-env-lint
make docker-lint
```

`make check` is the authoritative local validation command. It checks the uv
lockfile, Ruff, Markdown, Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions workflows and
environments, spelling, secrets, Bandit, deptry, pip-audit, tests and coverage,
minimum dependency versions, basedpyright, documentation links, built
distributions, and CycloneDX SBOM generation.

## Testing

The default test command runs unit, property-based, integration, and packaging
smoke tests with branch coverage enabled:

```bash
make test
```

Useful focused runs:

```bash
uv run pytest -m unit
uv run pytest -m property
uv run pytest -m integration
uv run pytest -m "integration and slow"
uv run pytest -m "not slow"
```

Markers:

* `unit`: fast isolated tests for package behavior.
* `property`: Hypothesis-based tests for invariants and generated inputs.
* `integration`: tests that exercise installed packages or third-party runtime integrations.
* `slow`: slower subprocess or packaging tests.

## Multi-version checks

Run the supported interpreter matrix before changes that may vary by Python
version:

```bash
make test-matrix
```

Nox uses uv-backed environments and locked dependencies. Useful sessions:

```bash
uv run nox -s tests-3.11
uv run nox --tags quality
uv run nox --tags docs
uv run nox -s release
```

## Documentation loop

Edit files under `docs/`, then run:

```bash
make docs
```

`make docs` runs MkDocs in strict mode. It fails on broken navigation entries,
broken internal links, missing anchors, and Markdown warnings. Before changing
navigation or moving pages, use links relative to the current Markdown file so
MkDocs can validate them during the build.

Check the generated site links with:

```bash
make docs-linkcheck
```

Preview the site locally with:

```bash
make serve-docs
```

API reference pages under `reference/api/` are generated from package
docstrings by `docs/_scripts/gen_api_reference.py`; do not create those pages by
hand. Update public docstrings and exports when public behavior changes.

## Working locations

* `src/patiencepilot/`: package implementation.
* `tests/`: unit, property, integration, and smoke tests.
* `docs/`: MkDocs documentation source.
* `reports/`, `site/`, `dist/`, `.nox/`: generated local artifacts that should not be committed.
