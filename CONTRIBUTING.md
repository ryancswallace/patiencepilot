# Contributing to patiencepilot

Thanks for considering a contribution.

For contribution expectations, see the docs site pages for
[Contributing](docs/project/contributing.md) and
[Development](docs/project/development.md).
Those pages are the canonical place for the local setup, focused test commands,
and repository layout.

## Before you start

For substantial changes, open an issue first so the problem and proposed
direction can be discussed. Small fixes and documentation improvements can go
directly to a pull request.

By participating, you agree to follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please report security vulnerabilities through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a
public issue.

## Local checks

The normal pre-submission loop is:

```bash
make format
make check
```

Run `make test-matrix` before changes that may vary by supported Python version
or packaging environment. Documentation changes should pass `make docs`, and
public API behavior changes should update tests, docstrings, docs, and
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) when users will notice the change.

## Pull requests

Keep each pull request focused on one coherent change. In the description,
explain the problem, the chosen approach, compatibility impact, and verification
performed.
